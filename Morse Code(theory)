DESCRIPTION :
Morse Code is a communications "language" that was initially developed for transmission of letter by letter textual information by wire using the telegraph system.
The code has also found wireless applications using signal lamps and audio devices and has also been used in long range radio communications and radio navigation applications.

International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:

'a' maps to ".-",
'b' maps to "-...",
'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.

Morse code theory centers on encoding text into standardized sequences of short (dots/dits) and long (dashes/dahs) signals, separated by silence, allowing for efficient long-distance communication via telegraphy
and radio waves. Its core principle is a variable-length code, assigning shorter codes to more frequent letters (like 'E' as a single dot) for speed, using precise timing (dash is 3x dot length) for clarity, and
forming a robust, human-decodable system for binary (on/off) transmission. 

DEVELOPMENT AND SYSTEM :
American Morse: Developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for early telegraphy.
International Morse Code: Adopted in 1851 (refined later), it's the global standard, including more punctuation and special characters, simplified for European use and wider adoption. 

TRANSMISSION AND APPLICATION :
Mediums: Can be sent via electrical pulses (telegraph), sound, flashing lights, or radio waves.
Applications: Revolutionized communication, used in maritime distress (SOS), and remains a vital skill in amateur radio and aviation.
